[Speaker 1]
Together. And, you know, the objective of this is, you know, everyone is to touch base on How it went, you know, creating project. Second is where we are with the project. What's done? What needs to be done? And the third most important thing as you are all aware of is what do we want to tell? Paul when it's going to be done, Um, So with that is Then I'll leave with you on because you are organizing all the tasks. Are all the tasks that created. I know they're not all assigned but are all the tasks created that you're aware of are there are and there any more that need to be done just for now. I mean I'm sure there's going to be more tasks later as we delve into stuff. But we had a good spot.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I I believe we have the fundamental task, the the tasks that still need to be done. Those are up in Devops as tasks under the pvis that were created.

[Speaker 1]
Great.

[Speaker 2]
Um but again like you said there may be additional tasks that we'll need to add

[Speaker 1]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah moving in in the future. Yep. Yeah. Especially as

[Speaker 1]
You dive into you know the you know what have you know what's what's been done and then you know the Lessons Learned that you know everyone you know tea and Sasha what you guys had with the comp Services especially and Matt when you're diving with that. Got to be updated. Um, Second question, I have. And open it up for as, as everyone has assigned stuff. But everyone has a signed tasks. There's nobody not having tasks. Is that correct or no?

[Speaker 3]
That's correct.

[Speaker 1]
Friend, the reason for that is the reason why I asked that question is because I want to make sure Again it's all for you guys you know, handing off working with each other but more importantly is trying to show our core that now that we have back to a team of four, we can get stuff done. And that's what that's the reason for that question. Um, So, So, so the next question is, What do we know that is done and the term of scrambling that Of all the actions we have. What's done?

Anybody can jump in, is that all

[Speaker 2]
Slashy, that's done. So we have a

We have a spreadsheet. Done slash to Do's. That we have set up so that still needs to be shared with the team. Um, so that's not it's not so like that's, that's the state of that. Like at least I think we, we have a good understanding of what's done and what's not done. Um, through that spreadsheet. I was planning on sharing it later this afternoon. Um, Is that

[Speaker 1]
Something that we could have used in just looking at the TFS and seeing what pbis are done or tasks that are done? I mean, that's

[Speaker 2]
Like so, so this spreadsheet is a culmination of PVI tasks historic, the ones historical ones, the ones that currently exist, the new ones, And then anything in the Deep requirements, so like it's all information that exists.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't exist but just it probably it needs your view license. And what we're doing with TFS is that why I'm just trying to find out the extra work or why when I do that? And if, if we can't, we can do it to you.

[Speaker 2]
Um, so I, I just feel like I, there's certain like wait um, there there may be other ways to view the information that is easier to for for Um, we we invited Ray Duncan to look at the the board. It didn't seem like there was much interest there, so I think that's why.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Uh,

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah, okay. Yo

[Speaker 4]
Um, So I

[Speaker 1]
Want to get into the more as I understand, you know, but here's here's where I'm trying to get at guys. So like you guys have been working at this for a few weeks now and we and I've been dancing around. Paul's request of giving getting dates and stuff as Sasha and T do all too. Well, we always get him. He works waterfall in wants dates because that's what the management wants. With all the work that had been done meaning, you know, vetting through the code that you guys, you know, exactly like you and Matt had gone through and then the structure of creating the project and then last week working together, I know. It took a couple of days, I was hoping to get it faster, but I understand about this more tests to be done. I need to get, here's the things we need to get to know where we are. And we're behind, I'll tell you right back right now in regards on what they've been asking for for weeks now. And I'm now getting to a point. I can't can't dance anymore. So, I gave your guidance on this.

[Speaker 4]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Can I look for another job?

[Speaker 4]
Finally, look for another job. We're way behind.

[Speaker 2]
Leon. I'm not sure what is being asked of us because so we have the tasks I'm

[Speaker 4]
Gonna let you stand on top.

[Speaker 2]
We we did, we did the lights as a team. We figured out how many points we estimated the PBIs to be. So now we have a good understander like an estimate of of how much time we've this this would take and the rate a range of what. So then like what what else are we do? We need that hasn't been

[Speaker 1]
Shared. You guys might know but we need to go and how do we share that?

[Speaker 5]
So, no might lose it. That's

[Speaker 1]
What I'm saying. I haven't been been given You know, exacts. I've been said, you know, I've been told like, if this was one person, this is how long would it take? I was okay, well, how many? Yeah, it's

[Speaker 5]
Impossible to give time some things. We, we

[Speaker 1]
Don't have a requirements for we don't even know what these details of what we're supposed to be doing manager. But he wants you to management needs to know that I understand in your Vantage point, you know, regardless of it. You you see you guys see all the actions that you guys need to do. Second half of that is communicating out. Now is where we're at. Sasha

[Speaker 3]
I think we, we kind of um, in the last weeks meeting itself. We kind of came to a point where uh like how much time from like we we were putting it in one man of us, but it's like one development or one resource assigned to this. One is around six and a half. Six months around. Six months, it takes complete and out of our four of us. Be dedicated to the spawn router and like we are looking at around three months. Itself. So, like, that is what we, we naturally talked about, like, can you please write me down that with my understanding, what's wrong? Like, maybe around poor, uh, to three months. We are looking again to keep some buffer. Uh, we may need some time, but that is, that is about back, not here, looking here to get this file down and into correction, at least the first Route. This is like this is like a faced phased out production. This may be a phase of production, most of the first 10 routes or 50 rows. Whichever deep clean designs. That would be the case. That's what my understanding was on the last meeting.

[Speaker 1]
So, three months, but again, things have already been done. Is that three months from it? Nothing had been done.

[Speaker 3]
And

[Speaker 5]
That's Brandon.

[Speaker 2]
What

[Speaker 3]
What we all went against was against the spreadsheet that we had that we decided upon and in the spreadsheet, whatever it is done, we decided on the system and this is connected and the pending work that came up and added on to the o. Each has its own estimate of like, how many pounds when we were trying to estimate and depending upon the point, how much time it takes to work on everything was estimated one person. So, that estimate of the work remaining, Was was the one which So it's a remaining word. That is there.

So,

[Speaker 1]
Thank you for the explanation of that. But again it's here's going to be the questions. I'm going to have to try to answer. I'm like, work has been done on this stuff and you guys would tell me that that's us. That's what's going to come. This is what Paul, that's what I do know.

[Speaker 3]
That's that's that's one thing

[Speaker 1]
I I understand.

Everything into cloud services. All right, Chris have done work. You guys have all done work. Here's the problem, is that he's going to Vision, they're like, okay, this product's going to take three months. Therefore, the actions that have previously have been done would take up just one of a number, you know, they've taken, you know, one Sprint. And therefore, we're, you know, we don't have, you know, we're less than three months, we're two months in a week. All I'm trying to say. And so, what you what we have to present is saying with is it's not a three-month project, it's probably a four one project with four, you know, four Engineers on it. That's what I'm trying to help you with, with regards of, like, how we're trying to answer things.

[Speaker 3]
Because I I think it's it's like the one how we particular of this one is To English pegging Grand Ham to things other things. It's, it's like, that's, that's what I envisioned it doing to to Engineers two and a half to three months. The other other two will be the three percent point or will be a perfect helpful. Right?

[Speaker 1]
It's just because work has already been done back in. Back in April and May and June. He's gonna ask her like okay, you guys did all that all that work, then you can't tell them. It's a three-month work, you have done the previous work. You know what I mean? You have to include that into if it's you're starting from like the last week is week. One

[Speaker 2]
Of,

[Speaker 1]
You know, the of the Sprint and we're looking at theoretically you know, five Sprites. So you know 15 weeks Explain to them. That's what I'm trying to.

[Speaker 3]
I I think it could be better if we all go through the the Excel and compare it with whatever record we have with the board. Then right? You should have done that last week. Yeah, he did the night out. But yeah. So we thought we've done that. We have done that and we came up with this. That's that's what I'm just trying to say, like, in order to give the good picture of what we are talking about. That's that's when I like,

We talked about saying to like Paul from the Thursday meeting that we, we were looking at that, but I'm not sure, but that's that's the case. That's the case. We we kind of came up with all the discussions that that came that meeting last week.

Daniel,

[Speaker 1]
Do you have anything on this? Because here's my perspective on this guys is that and thank you for all the information you're giving to me. It's what I'm having. I'm difficulty trying to absorb is Trying trying to have the ability to go to the mall and tell him. This is what we had, literally. This is where we are. This is what needs to be done left. This is how long it's going to take. Those three things.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we

We've had meetings to go over all those things. So We had meetings to look at what students still needs to be done. Everything that to Zena's point that is left to be done, is in a sprench or is mtfs and I guess sooner, you put that into a spreadsheet. Uh, yes. And I can I'm just going to show it now after we talk talk because I feel like Yeah, so so we have that piece of the puzzle. Then um, I also met with, uh, Shashi and Tiam. I think Thursday or Friday last week to go over any out like the older pbis and tasks to make sure we close those out. So there's nothing outstanding So everything in TFS is, what is left to be done, and then we had an additional meeting to talk about, you know, to do the point name that basically estimate the level of work for everything that's left. Um, And that was what was communicated. So we did. We did all those things.

[Speaker 6]
Um,

[Speaker 2]
Maybe

[Speaker 6]
A little bit confused.

[Speaker 2]
Um, But, Yeah, I think we did all of all of those things. Was there something else?

[Speaker 1]
So how can I, so, for Nina for you and I, how can I transfer that until Paul,

What do we have that? We would be able to, you know, to look at the numbers and find out what's left. Like, do you and I go on a TFS and then both of there because

[Speaker 2]
Weekly. But I also think to you guys earlier Point Paul is not going to want to see that. So we can't. Yeah, we could just add up like, okay, we have this many pdis and we have this many tasks associated to the PBIs and um because I mean I I guess when we do estimates and stuff, right, we don't want to actually do it like where it's like uh like by an hour, right? It's second level time, right? So

[Speaker 1]
But again it goes vice versa. Look at it you figure out okay. So I was like yeah. To your point, then you figure out what it is. My my problem that I'm trying, I have a difficulty, visualizing is

[Speaker 2]
Because I

[Speaker 1]
Keep on here in three months and he's gonna hear that and he's going to expect that. About to three months. What's already been done. So therefore, as of last week, that means you have 2 months.

[Speaker 2]
I can see him

[Speaker 1]
Do that. That's what I'm afraid of and I'm trying to absorb as much as I can. That's why I'm asking the questions I am because I'm trying to go through what he's probably going to ask of us because here's what's probably going to have been down to is if he's going to come back to get it by the end of the year. Just calling it out right now. And then we would have to readjust But at the priorities, unfortunately, for Sasha and T, you guys got a billion things on your plane already, with com services and trying to get the portal stuff going and the audit and all the other things, and that might happen just putting it out there. So

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So maybe there's a disconnect in between like all the information that I gathered from the team and how I communicated that team, maybe that's the missing.

[Speaker 1]
It's, it's more of like, because for me, it's because I can't literally see it of seeing what's actually done and because I just and the the The past experience that I have. With this and Sasha, you had mentioned, you know, phase one phase two Yeah, we're still waiting for phase two of our lovely com Services. I don't see that happening anytime soon and I don't want to be stuck with that again.

[Speaker 2]
So

[Speaker 1]
It's not because of us. We're doing. We're doing a great job doing what we're asked to do. It's what I'm fearful of is. All the Band-Aids, you guys have to do your face. One goes out. You know what I mean? I, I think that is a, the small miscom like

[Speaker 3]
Misdirectional face facing out here. So the, the phase that I am trying to put it in and the, uh, blood. I'm trying to explain it is When we had the project discussion of file router, We have like around 600 routes maybe 600.5 500 routes different different kinds of options. There are that vulnerable. We are not going to book everything all around. So can evil that on the day one. From the 500 perspective. So according to one of the discussions that we had with what they will identify is from their side, they will come up with 10 to 50 routes, which are less less effective. And they wanted to start with those 15 pounds to move it to production. They will go through the process of running those files through those 10 15 rounds for me, two days. One day, depends upon how they feel comfortable, then they keep on going and relax.

[Speaker 4]
Don't make it.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, 600, let's take. They will go out like, maybe, 15, 20 30 returns. It depends upon how things work out, but that's kind of one discussion that came out of a phasing. Uh, let's let's say, not a, let's not use the phase word out there because he feels as a different different, uh, different, uh, aspect or because there is a phase one phase to be talking about. I would say like, uh, Under just just around around about number. They will.

[Speaker 1]
That's

[Speaker 3]
What they were trying to do. So they will do, like, 15 first. They come up with. They are comfortable. They will add keep on adding those like maybe 20 30 at a time or depends upon their cuttings. That's that sir. One of the discussion that came. So that's what I was. Just trying to say that 10 15 routes that we are common code production, that is the date.

[Speaker 1]
Go under the current structures guys, then to that first

Where do you see that? When you see that possibly happening, are you saying that after three months? That's when the first the first, 15 or so starts. Are you saying that? Yeah, I'm I'm being under what I'm trying to do here is just try to help you just expose the side of things, the questions that we get asked. And so I'm asking you in a way to try to one, help me explain those things to

[Speaker 4]
The core

[Speaker 1]
To. So when then when Paul gets those questions, he's he has the answers that's why I'm asking him this way, is nothing in regards of all the work you guys are doing with this. It's more I I know what kind of questions he asked, that's why I'm asking him this way and so And so what would you say to that? Kind of kind of questions like when would that first phase happen? In three months. One more two and a half.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, whatever work we did. We were trying to plan and please connect me from 19 always. Now please feel free, whatever. Like we remaining work that we do after that. The first day of the production will be enough months. That's that's where we usually current after three months. Okay, now let's go this into this. This includes the testing of like from I, I think they would like to go with the full-blown testing in a time and they want to run the test envelopment and also you eating ramen for these things where they want to do testing and drawing it through for a few days, then move water production. So all these things comes into picture as

[Speaker 2]
I went to Brennan's point. Like this, let's say the three months that we estimate to get the work done. Does not exclude, keep them getting or asking my other routes up. It just includes those first 15

[Speaker 3]
15. Yeah we are we are talking about just the first possibility the first day of

[Speaker 4]
The production of our water.

Hey Brendan. So there's

[Speaker 2]
Three questions that I heard from you. Um, What's been done? What's left? And how long will that take? Um so so again I have not shared this with the team because it's just not done. But, but this is the, this is the spreadsheet. And this is all the things that have that, that that like we we believe needs to be done right to the completion. And this, this list comes from the Deep requirements. The the, the existing, um, The, the old pbis and the new PBIs. So and then and then we've we've gone through. As, as stated we went through the code and we we got it running and we checked, right? Okay, so this is done. Where's the code for this, right? So we went through all this exercise, and so we have these items are done and these items are to do. The reason it's not done is because I haven't linked them yet to the work items that currently exist in devops. Um these are this column here, right? Showing like this, like this needs to be this needs to be done um in Phase One. This is an MVP, this has to be done, for example, right, this item. So that's what true false means here. Um, phase we've

[Speaker 4]
Already talked about it.

What

[Speaker 5]
I just did my full body. Oh here listen, I gotta go pee. Listen to tell me if I even call me.

[Speaker 4]
Oh good, you're working out.

Uh-Oh.

[Speaker 5]
I I I just like this. I'd like to, I don't know maybe 15 minute meeting with you. Just me and you from screen sharing just from a development point of view. I I just have a different perspective on. Like I want, I want you to understand more what this app is, what currently works, what we're working on day to day. What needs to work Um, that's my best. Thought from the whole thing is, like, I just want you to understand. It's, I feel like you're having, it's all so fuzzy to you, what's done? What's not done? And if I could somehow show you what we've been doing and how it works now, and what we need to get done, Maybe that could help. I don't know. That's, that's all I got.

Yeah, that's a, that's the big part. Also, like for, I'll just give an example for today. There's, uh, at some point they imported the data from SQL to these table storage tables. So, today, I was creating a console app, extracting all that code out, getting it to run on a separate app. So, I could run that on different environments and that's there's no documentation about this. This is just things. We're finding out as we're digging into the code like, oh, I got the, we got to get this import code working or there's some, you know, these there's six different six six. Exactly what they're all used for. So it's as a developer, the toughest part is, we're coming in. There's no documentation things are broken. We don't know what's broken until we like as we're getting things up and running going, oh, for example, the dashboard, there's a scan screen that doesn't work. There's a report screen, there's nothing there. I guess, they did no reporting. We're, we're learning all this, the, our only documentation is the code day-to-day. So it's really, it's an unusual situation for a developer to have. No, you know, just to be like, well, just here's a code figure. It all out by looking at the code, And that, and we're just, we're doing our best trying to get things up and running, and finding these short-term goals for us to accomplish. So, we have, so we, we can show something like, one idea. I had, I was telling Zeno was Approach to take is, let's say, let's do a demo, let's say like two weeks from now. We're going to demonstrate these Concepts that these work and maybe that would be better than just continually going on in TFS and saying things are done. But actually be able to demonstrate like we're going to demonstrate these 10 points and here it's the 10 points and they're all working and then say the next three weeks from now, now we're going to do you know, do whatever else. And that's another way to show that we're making progress and for everyone to understand what's done and what's working. So that's another other

[Speaker 4]
Okay, that's

[Speaker 5]
So that's that's an idea. If you could be like, okay, uh, you don't show these pieces of functionality and let's see.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, he's

[Speaker 5]
Got to lose.

[Speaker 1]
Is there anything assigned to you? Because because,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, Tea is starting to play crybaby like they're not. They're not

[Speaker 4]
That. That's the question for me.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. You're gonna see the reaction waiting

[Speaker 1]
On stuff. So I'm like so I just want to come and say I was just asking if Not assigned to you or here it is, everything's for the Sprint. Yeah, yeah I mean we had the resource errors assigned to me. So um, Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
So do something that's

[Speaker 1]
Done.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I mean attacks aren't done. No. All right. So bear

[Speaker 1]
With me on what you were saying. You're saying you're waiting on something cuz I wanted to confirm

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I'm I'm assuming I'm assuming I still need some like, you know, some more refinement like, you know, Matt was just saying he got to build this whole console indoor thing, but that was already done. It was already like an important thing that was done. So, I mean, I feel like there. There's still like this disconnect as far as what's done. What's not done? What's working? What's not working? It's not done. I,

[Speaker 5]
I can't I can't run. How do I run the Importer? There's no instructions. I don't see any endpoint. I don't know, all I have is the code.

[Speaker 4]
You didn't ask me. The first I'm hearing about this is right now.

[Speaker 1]
So, So so with that guys, that's probably you know if but again for both sides is there's a task out there to do to do the console. And yeah that's why you just thrown the song on the bus, you all the pbis in the tasks. So that but, you know, he from Sashi, especially you guys because of the history, you guys have. You know what's done? That's why I'm going back to that again. And now we're hearing that hold on Brendan so, so are

[Speaker 2]
So how many, how many resources are gonna be on file writer? And, uh, can can we can we, can we clear that up?

[Speaker 1]
All four are accessible to be jumping on file router and I mentioned that many times primary but all four should be on this thing and I mentioned that many times.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah and

[Speaker 1]
I'm saying all four writing code. What I'm saying? What else are they doing?

[Speaker 2]
Are for writing code. Like I don't, I don't know what other tasks are are involved. Like if, if we are assigned tasks, then we're writing code for this. So that's why, I guess I'm I'm asking all four reasons

[Speaker 1]
Here's a good example that we're just talking about with Matt having to go to a console is that that task maybe you should with the four you guys together T. Maybe as a, here's the task for this T could have said I'm not I want to put words in mouthy or maybe it was an express saying hey That console was built four months ago. Um, so that you know, let me show you where we're at. And then it starts with you're reassigning something, it's trying to be more effective so that everyone

[Speaker 5]
You don't know what he's talking about. It wasn't done, it was neither done. I thought I mentioned a few weeks ago

[Speaker 1]
Because it was a tough, it's a very tough project because Duffy dirty was done previously. To try to pick up what we've left off. And as Matt as you had mentioned that a lot of stuff, not out there because the

[Speaker 4]
Guys

[Speaker 1]
That had done, some of this work aren't here.

[Speaker 2]
I guess. Can I can I clarify something? I know I'm talking format here and I'm, I'm sorry, but I, I just we, we taught, right? And like, the way he described what he's doing right now is not my understanding of. We're not like I seen him doing the stuff that he's saying. So like my point is, he's not, it's not a task that he's writing a console app for which then is gonna go into production or gonna be checked in. He's, we're trying to figure out how the application works. Sometimes we have to pull code out. Sometimes we're going to write console app to try and just figure out how that code works. And then later on, now that we understand now we can move on. Like this is not a console app that is needed for the test. Does that, does that make sense? And so, like, I just I'm, I'm, yeah, like, I guess, I guess you have to like Matt is, is that right? Or like, am I am I misunderstanding?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, so the console app was just to help me do some things that I had to do manually. And so, rather than me manually create folders set up Azure, right? Put in test data into table storage. Created that and on top of that, I noticed that the test Azure table storage had like 400 routes. So I had to go. Look, I discovered, there's code called import.cs is one of the files. It seems to import this data. So I said well that's going to probably be needed at some point to be able to re-import the data. And so that's what I did. There was no existing cons web that I no one ever told me anything, but that's just the code, I discovered

[Speaker 2]
Writing this isn't a console activity, right? This

[Speaker 5]
Is not part of the app, it's just helping me.

[Speaker 2]
Way of of working. Like, and so we're not rewriting, we're not, we're not creating something, we're not double working, this is just how Matt works. And and so like, No,

[Speaker 1]
I appreciate it. No, and I understand the frustration and stuff, but also, it's like so tea, I'm like, help me out here. I'm like, so obviously was a console that he built, but you said something was already built. Help me try to understand what you're referring to to.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so there wasn't, it wasn't a costal application per se, but if there was

Have done, it wasn't a console out. I think it was just like a class or something like that. And was that

[Speaker 1]
P. So here's the question. That's what fall for you? Was that mentioned when you guys met last week, that, that was built.

[Speaker 2]
Bernie. We know that it was already built, we're not saying that it's not built or built or not built. What, what met all that Matt did was take? I

[Speaker 1]
Totally did just. Now, what I'm hearing was to get at is that it's really an amazing who's trying to help you guys get together and work together. Matthew doing a server console. I'm fine with that. I'm not talking about it. I'm just trying to get the point of that. There was another piece that barely was built and I understand And head down and getting something done. But that's the piece I was trying to understand more from UT is that If something had already been there and it wasn't communicated out last week. I'm just wondering, are we going to come across that as as team as a whole? Are we going to come across this throughout you know this project that's what's going to take us three months and we're going to come across things and it's like oh yeah that's done but You know. You look at it again

[Speaker 4]
Or we just

[Speaker 1]
Didn't know that that that had happened created. Let's make this to my whole world overall Bonita. Go ahead.

[Speaker 2]
I was just gonna say, I feel like our conversations. We, we met like three or four times, uh, last week, um, to discuss this very thing. Um, and we've met, you know, all together with Paul. We had several meetings before when I settled but you know, three or four before to discuss this very thing. So I feel like this book, we talked at Nazi about what has been done. What hasn't been done? Is there anything? That's, that's not TFS that needs to be there, which there? Until they get into like, yeah, we just got into it. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna find out later. Yeah, for sure,

[Speaker 2]
Great. So, I just feel like, you know, Unless it's like something. I don't know. Super middle school that I agree with you. They should go back and be like, hey we think we need to need to do this thing but have you already done it. I feel like we've already Had that platform that was those discussions to figure out what has already been done so we don't, you know,

[Speaker 1]
That's my only concern.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's my concern

[Speaker 1]
Because to your point and to everyone's point I don't want you guys having, you know, you're two months into this. I mean, you know, say just need to get teen shot. You guys are getting into this and then you come to find out and you kind of start all over again or something. I don't I'd hate for you guys. And and then

[Speaker 5]
Brandon, you know,

[Speaker 1]
All that stuff out. Now before you have to go in and start, you know, building code. Again, that's what we're trying to help out with, with this project, is that we're trying to a relatively You know, more transparent style so that we all know, you know what, our the best of our knowledge of, you know what, what's out there? So that Yeah. But this is a great example of it just because, hey news, there's a project that started at the start of the year and we had to drop it, powered back up and we're finding a lot of things and learning a lot from the com services, and we're learning a lot. You know, you know, like a lot of options. But again, communication lines over and just say, hey, I found this guy said this before, or I'm going to go create a console for this.

Because they have distinct voices, introducing a step. It just feels

[Speaker 5]
Like Brandon's trying to kind of Brandon's in trouble with Paul, so he's trying to throw up Sparkles like

[Speaker 1]
Gotta do this, but

[Speaker 4]
It's

[Speaker 1]
Just going to help going forward, especially when we go. And when you guys are going to get asked questions, and I'm telling you guys right now that knowing call, he'll go around us and ask specific people individually to try to see if he's going to get a different answer from one of you guys. And that's another piece of why I want you guys to just

[Speaker 5]
Screwed this whole project up and they're trying to get it done, but they don't know what they're doing happening and we're stuck in the middle. Is it

[Speaker 1]
Say something different? Yeah, what That's another thing. I'm just trying to help you, that's what happened. So Gonna happen, what? That gotta be nice to be neither but it's important. That's why I'm

[Speaker 5]
I might not have a job much longer, so, enjoy your nails.

[Speaker 2]
At a minimum. We should at least be able to discuss things as a team, you

[Speaker 5]
Know, the right things are going won't be fired again.

[Speaker 2]
And

[Speaker 5]
But they're good at making excuses all the time.

Everyone keeps interrupting us.

[Speaker 2]
I think.

[Speaker 4]
An issue. I'll say

[Speaker 2]
That.

[Speaker 1]
Because all you guys may not be aware of it or not, but this is some of the things that he likes to do. So.

[Speaker 4]
If something happened, I understand.

[Speaker 2]
I'm I won't go into details but my, I, to Brendan's point, right? Um, Paul does who like to hit each of us up separately. I personally was drove by him for 45 minutes. About something last week, which again, I'm not going to go into details. I don't really feel like it's the helpful productive to this conversation. But um, As a VA, I do think that you know part of my job is in also Brandon's job is protecting our development team, from our stakeholders, in the sense that you know, we're all on the same page.

[Speaker 4]
And sometimes, when

[Speaker 2]
Paul Goes around. Brennan goes around me to the rest of the team and we don't all have the same answer or at least at a minimum deal attempt to Brennan to get those answers. It becomes an issue because he's our stakeholder Um, and regardless of what it may seem like, what he's talking to you last time, or something as the United front, with the same answers, and the same, You know, I guess like, Plans for the project is for him worrisome, and that's an issue for him. So I all I'm saying is that I would like for us to just be able to visit as a as a United friend to him, and I don't think that's happening right now.

[Speaker 1]
Just to wrap up what, you know, as soon as you were mentioning about, you know what Matt was doing. Yeah, like that's great, just but again communicating with each other, you know, use that AIS team to say with the actions that are going on. Um, And because again we're trying our best to put the shield up so you guys can get the stuff that you can do and get it done. You know, there's been other instances where you may get a request from somebody as not in our scope and it's not in, you know what, you know, in TFS is not a PBI or something like that. We gotta go in and and help you with that, you're getting paid directly because you know, it's if that action is taking away, from what our core is wanting us to do. I want to get in there so that I can, you know, you know, squash it find out, you know, redirect it and and find out more because every little bit of time is going to come back. And that's these are some of the things we're just trying to As, as you're finding out with cftc. It's part of the environment and we're just trying to This does the guys go enjoy and go go do code and go, go create the, you know, the tools that are needed and you don't have to worry about all this drama. And it's just, but there are times that it can

[Speaker 4]
Happen, I, I get.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't like, I'm I feel like we're yeah, I don't know. Like so, yeah, I don't know. I'm I, I guess I'm I'm I'm, I'm I, I thought we were. I thought we were trying. I thought we were communicating and like, we've talked like, I just end and again like this. This one thing about import importer that Is trying to just try and understand and read the code and that that turns into then that we're not communicating and like, I don't know, like this is, yeah, I'm I'm really struggling with this like

[Speaker 1]
Same things, I don't know what I'm saying. So that's the point of the front end of last week was to go through all the tasks confirm, everybody and be good and then we go so that way to your point is we don't have drama, it's okay. We did that. Right? Like is is there

[Speaker 2]
A is? Do we disagree on that? Done.

[Speaker 1]
It wasn't here. So I'm just,

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, I'm sorry. But, I'm asking the, the, the, the everyone I guess like, was that not done? Yeah, cuz I can't deal with that.

[Speaker 1]
On it but you know things that fire up later on and stuff just

[Speaker 2]
You just have huddles,

[Speaker 1]
You know, something's not right here.

[Speaker 2]
Pick it out, gets it up, and we are doing that. We we have, we, we are communicating. We are reaching out to the AAS team. We, when we have questions, we we do bring it up. We're not we're not just scratching our heads and being like, welcome, I guess that's instead. And so then and so, so then, like one one, one statement that maybe wasn't um, worded, right? Like and turns into now like the the same the the the same I don't know what is it the same conversation that we've been having of not communicating, and so like, I don't I don't I I I've exhausted a lot of the other the options at this point. I'm not sure what else. I can be, we can be doing to to to to to squash these concerns.

[Speaker 1]
Um it's just doing it, just doing the work, that's all you gotta do. I I

[Speaker 5]
Think the best thing is just to have that list share the list and and say this is what we're working on today. I don't

[Speaker 1]
Maybe that'll work. Yeah, no. Can you guys get, you know, figure out the weights and stuff like that? Then we have a great base of, you know, when Anita. And I gotta go in the show. Show Paul the project. You know then go create the project plan so that he can then present to his Executives and then they go forward. That part is Like last week when he had asked about that I said yeah I got that. Yeah

[Speaker 2]
On this Excel spreadsheet for that then like is is that a prerequisite? Because the weights are getting to the pbis already and and I feel like we should be able to create a project plan out of that. Is that not the case? Do is there anything else you you need far from us to to help what are you saying? We're already doing all this

[Speaker 1]
Coining and everything else, we'll warning you about and that becomes another like

Me and I will go and take stuff off at TFS. Is left. Yeah, he's he's done this to me twice already since I've been here since May That's why I was that's why I asked that the question about if it could be done by TFS, he's done it multiple times already speaking something. And created something off of that that wasn't necessarily a mutual scope. Just giving you guys just a little bit of like what we're dealing with here. Oh really so that you guys can just focus and get stuff done. So sometimes when Somebody asks for something new or guest star and or something in a different way. You gotta be cautious because they can come back. And they'll use that. And that's the only thing, I'm just Dear dear points out. Do I want it to be? There's like, no, because there's no, there's no notes. It's just an Excel spreadsheet, to help you organize stuff. What? I'm telling you that some people will use that is, that's the Holy Grail. Okay, so we

[Speaker 2]
Don't show this but then we also don't show the devops so I guess like what? No,

[Speaker 1]
No we used that. No, I didn't know. So take a step back and regards to TFS and the devops. That's something that Paul and stuff going to them will extract everything off TFS. Because that's the, that is to me and I need That's just that's a known source. That's just that is it? That's what we're going off of. Anything that's extrapolated outside of. That is not the source. What I do with that is, then I go in and look and dive into all the pbis that are done. All the tests that are done showing all those reports, banging that out, But then I can extrapolate it into a different. Vision for the, for the ex the executives and all that is. Is a freaking flowchart. That's cool.

[Speaker 4]
She's

[Speaker 7]
A woman in here, guys.

[Speaker 1]
Here's all of our tasks. Here's all stuff that's been done.

[Speaker 5]
See, she's the one at the

[Speaker 1]
Every time.

[Speaker 7]
You know, six pregnant women teeth. They're talking I said we've been cleaning him. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
So I take that stuff and

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
So they don't want to see it because they don't want to see TFS. They don't want to see all that. Well

[Speaker 3]
It's gotta go in, simplify it so that he can, I'm freezing. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Turn it off or set the schedule

[Speaker 1]
Or the heater. Now it's going

[Speaker 5]
To need to hear

[Speaker 1]
Some conversation with Paul

[Speaker 5]
Unless they're getting 50 40 degrees outside, he can look at it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, it does. Look like they just want answers.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so there's there's nothing you need from us at this point.

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pull off to you guys. I'm like the ex. I'll just, you know, the Excel. You guys have makes it easier for your great. I'd be keep it within the team, do not share that out.

[Speaker 2]
Okay?

[Speaker 1]
Um, and Paul's asking for a different type of thing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So so then in regards to uh task not being assigned. I don't think we finished that conversation. Um, I think I think maybe we can if we take blood.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, okay. Well I'll I'll just say this. If you guys feel like you need to do need more work of this stuff. Bring it up. Yeah, and generally you'll you can go delegate out more thing. I know you're doing spring by Sprint. On that. But, uh, Okay, so I'm I'm I'm delegating tasks. No. What I'm saying is if you're, if everyone's looking for more tests, I'm going to go to you and saying hey in in regards to the project, could you helped create the project? I'm like are we going to is there anything? That's going to be priority over one another piece because to Anita and I what we'll do is like we're going to look at TMS up and what's there? But I'll check with you just to confirm like, Yeah, you helped build this. Is to understand is I guess, you know it's you know you could you're being you were all for, you were going to be in the weeds with this. I'm just gonna go check the people. Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I've been operating under the assumption that there was two resources working on this but I I don't think that

[Speaker 1]
Assumption is correct. Yeah no not all four of you guys are on this thing because Paul wants this thing done yesterday and I so all of it hadn't reiterated that numerous times over the last month, I said, all four of you guys are going to be assigned to this thing. Four family sources are coding back. Well, I need a yes or no, answer on that.

[Speaker 2]
Sure bus. Okay. Okay. All right. So four resources code,

[Speaker 3]
That's why the communication is going to be big with you guys.

[Speaker 4]
Is you

[Speaker 1]
Got, you know, there's, you know, with, you know, sections are going to be done. You guys going to talk to each other with this?

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. We're all going to be working on it. So all four of us are going to be on foul rider.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Sounds good. Thanks for clarify.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. My apologize, if it wasn't, you know, saying that earlier because It. And the reason reason for that again, is that the initial part is, if you go help build this out with us, Give you the opportunity to go and create it and you've done it done a great job with that. Next thing wants them to all four of you guys jump in and do stuff. And you can start banging this thing out because with the

[Speaker 3]
With

[Speaker 1]
All four, you guys, We now have a great opportunity to Get Paul's request and get it out of the door

[Speaker 4]
And I

[Speaker 3]
Know

[Speaker 1]
Because it comes, here's the big thing and you're going to get a lot of history from T and Sashi that when you guys weren't here, but you're also the other side guys, you know, is that Zeno and Matt are going to have experiences outside of TFC. TFT cftc. Where Ganache should benefit us, you know, from stuff that's been done in the past. So that's why I think it's a great opportunity to supporting guys to working together and getting this thing done. With a big win for all of us. Not just to it. It was all four of you guys on us.

Does sound like a plan yet?

[Speaker 4]
I'm good,

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Who is the, who is the lead developer for this, for file router? Okay good.

[Speaker 1]
You know, because he upgraded the project in that piece but all four of you guys have been doing doing pieces. So

Is there anything that you guys are butting heads on that? You think? Which way to go? That's when you bring Anita and I in Because we want to make because again, the priority is what the core was. So The last time I didn't mentioned before, Even after. In three months or two and a half months, just getting this done. I'm gonna get up and getting only, you know, 15 or so lines. Going and they had 700 to go We got to figure out how long that's, you know, that's going to take, you know, because he's got a lot. What's the next thing? Which is going to be the email and another pieces that he wants just up and running. We got to figure out how we're going to manage that. So All right, I got three more minutes until we gotta jump into the branch discussions. So why don't you guys go? The bio break for a few minutes and then uh we'll connect again, uh, the three o'clock. Hi. I

[Speaker 3]
Can I add something here Brennan? Just, I have one minute. Uh, I think It could be a good idea to have DSL detail number because he has all the knowledge on this I'll find out that because um there needs to be and how we need to communicate to deep and it it would come into that point. It's it's just my two cents are

[Speaker 4]
Um

[Speaker 3]
And I think that that is gonna that is gonna cause that is the question that's all gonna have as well. Like,

[Speaker 1]
That's what I can just say. How we assign

[Speaker 2]
Resources?

[Speaker 1]
And they understand that. But there's other things you guys aren't aware of of why we're doing it this way.

[Speaker 3]
You should I, I just wanted to put it on this one. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
With the other task that especially Sash 18, where you guys have, especially with the other other items and stuff. There's a lot on your plate. I know you can take it and you you can run with it, but there's other other factors that all for you guys are unaware of that of why when that decision was made.

[Speaker 3]
Shut up. Fuck it. I end up one one more suggestion. Like, when we are going out with saying, For resources are not found out there. I think we need to just have two or three sources with nearly 50 50 because of the other task. That's come up every um,

[Speaker 1]
Yes yes.

[Speaker 5]
It's almost over,

[Speaker 1]
Especially with the general map being very new. And as, you know, getting them up to speed on those pieces. But also, you know, trying to get everybody on board AIS side,

[Speaker 4]
And

[Speaker 1]
But then, that's where we made a decision. So, We're going that route.

All right guys, we got one minute. Go to the bathroom, come on.

[Speaker 3]
In

[Speaker 1]
A minute, on the next call.

[Speaker 4]
Thursday, man.

[Speaker 5]
Well, Thursday is

[Speaker 8]
It's 3 P.M on the 6th announcement. I

[Speaker 5]
Got a 11 o'clock from 18 at one o'clock meeting and a two o'clock meeting.

[Speaker 8]
Not drink your water and go hug Kim even when she's angry.
